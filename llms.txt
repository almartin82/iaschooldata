Fetch and analyze Iowa public school enrollment data from the Iowa
Department of Education.

## What can you find with iaschooldata?

**34 years of enrollment data (1992-2025).** 515,000 students today.
Over 320 districts. Here are ten stories hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Iowa’s enrollment is remarkably stable

While neighboring states lose students, Iowa has held steady at around
500,000 students for three decades. No boom, no bust.

``` r
library(iaschooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(c(1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025))

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Des Moines is the only large district

Des Moines Public Schools serves 33,000 students, nearly 10x larger than
the next biggest district. Iowa education is fundamentally rural.

``` r
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students) %>%
  head(10)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. The Hispanic transformation of Iowa

Hispanic students went from 2% to 13% of enrollment since 1992.
Meatpacking towns like Storm Lake, Denison, and Marshalltown are now
majority Hispanic.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "hispanic") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct)
```

Storm Lake Community School District is now over 70% Hispanic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. COVID barely dented Iowa enrollment

Iowa lost only 8,000 students during COVID, one of the smallest drops in
the nation. The state’s rural character may have helped.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2019:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Rural consolidation never stops

Iowa had over 400 districts in 1992. Today it has around 320. Every
year, more rural districts merge as enrollment shrinks.

``` r
purrr::map_df(c(1995, 2005, 2015, 2025), fetch_enr) %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  summarize(n_districts = n())
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. 56 districts have fewer than 300 students

Iowa’s smallest districts serve just a few hundred students. Ringgold
County has fewer than 200. The economics of small-town education are
brutal.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  filter(n_students < 300) %>%
  arrange(n_students) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students) %>%
  head(10)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Kindergarten is holding steady

Unlike many states where kindergarten enrollment is plummeting, Iowa’s
kindergarten numbers remain stable. Birth rates have not collapsed.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "K") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. English Learners have tripled

Iowa’s ELL population grew from 10,000 to 35,000 students since 2000.
Schools in rural communities now need ESL teachers.

``` r
fetch_enr_multi(2000:2025) %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "lep") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. The urban-rural divide grows

Waukee, Ankeny, and West Des Moines suburbs are growing. Rural districts
lose a dozen students each year. Two Iowas are emerging.

``` r
suburbs <- c("Waukee Community School District", "Ankeny Community School District",
             "West Des Moines Community School District")

enr %>%
  filter(district_name %in% suburbs, is_district,
         grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = district_name, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Iowa remains 80% white

Despite demographic shifts, Iowa public schools are still predominantly
white. Black students are concentrated in Des Moines, Davenport, and
Waterloo.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct))
```
